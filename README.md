# Installing
Make sure your Psych Engine build supports modding AND HScript/SScript.

- Download the mod using the green button that says "Code", then click "Download ZIP".
- Once the .zip is downloaded, extract it and cut the folder inside it, and paste it to your Psych Engine mods folder.
- Run your Psych Engine build, and check the Mods screen. It should be at the bottom of your mods. Though, I recommend you to move it to the top.
